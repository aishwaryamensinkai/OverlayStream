## 📂 File Structure
```
.
├── app.py              # Main application entry point
├── config.py           # Configuration settings for Flask and MongoDB
├── requirements.txt    # Required Python packages
├── routes.py           # Application routes definitions
└── uploads             # Directory for storing uploaded files
```

## 📜 Description of Files

- **app.py**: This is the main entry point for the application, initializing Flask and setting up routes.
- **config.py**: Contains configuration settings for the Flask application and MongoDB connection.
- **routes.py**: Defines the routes/endpoints for the application.

## 🚀 Running the Application

1. Start your MongoDB server if it's not already running.
2. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. By default, the application will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

## 🔄 Available Routes

The available routes for this application are defined in `routes.py`. They interact with the MongoDB database and perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## 🛡️ Configuration

You can modify the MongoDB configuration settings in `config.py` to connect to your desired database.

## 🖼️ Handling File Uploads

The `uploads` directory is used to store uploaded files such as `DSC00620.jpg` and `logo.png`. You can add or remove files as needed.

## 🔧 Additional Information

- **Python Cache Files**: The `__pycache__` folder contains Python's compiled bytecode files. You can safely ignore or delete this folder if needed.
